# TDM-EST-Bus-Speeds

This repository is for estimating new traffic to bus speed ratios using traffic speeds from an output congested TDM network and GTFS bus schedule data. The traffic to bus speed ratios represent the speed ratio for which buses travel in the TDM network. In other words, compared to how fast traffic moves in the TDM, what ratio of that speed will buses travel?

An interactive Shiny webapp was developed to help make decisions about the ratios and better understand the data. See [here](https://christopher-day.shinyapps.io/bus_speeds_viewer/).
